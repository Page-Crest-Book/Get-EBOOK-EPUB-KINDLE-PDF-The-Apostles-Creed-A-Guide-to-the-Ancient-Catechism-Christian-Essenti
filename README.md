You recite it. But do you understand it?The Apostles‚Äô Creed has become so familiar to us that we don‚Äôt think about what we‚Äôre saying. Christians from different times, places, and traditions have been united by its eternal truths. We believe them, we recite them, but do we build our lives on them?The fact that so many in the early church died for their faith means they were caught up in something greater than themselves. What were those truths? How did they empower a revolution? How did early church pastors and theologians use the Apostles‚Äô Creed as the essential guide to the basics of the Christian l

The Apostles' Creed: A Guide to the Ancient Catechism (Christian Essentials) by Ben Myers Book Review

Name: Adam Shields
Rating: 4.0 out of 5 stars
Title: ShortfocusedchaptersonthemeaningoftheApostlesCreed
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2018
Review: I have been more focused on catechesis (the training and instruction about matters of Christian faith) over the past several years as I have both become more liturgical in theological bias and more focused on spiritual formation.Discipleship (which in some ways is another way of thinking of catechesis), means growing to be more like Christ. It is not about becoming a particular culture or look or personality or knowing certain things, but it is about growing to become more like Christ.Part of what I have become convinced is that we should not be training people to avoid sin, although I am not denying the reality of sin or the harm that it does, but training them toward right desires. I think porn is one of the most simple ways of illustrating this, I have heard from many that their desire to consume porn could not be managed away. Knowing porn was bad for them and simply trying to be better was not what has worked for many that I have talked to. Understanding the subject of the porn as created in the image of God and distorting the goodness of sex and their bodies for the titillation of others, usually strangers, by my anecdotal evidence, seems to be more effective. The right understanding of good things and the right desire for those good things is more important than personal desire to not do wrong.What does that have to do with the Apostles‚Äô Creed? The Apostles‚Äô Creed is one of the oldest distillations and positive affirmations of the Christian faith. The Creed was likely first used as a baptismal statement of faith. An affirmation of what we believe and who we believe in. The Apostles‚Äô Creed is a positive statement. If you know some church history you can see where some of those statements are blocking false beliefs, but it is mostly about what we positively believe.Ben Myers is setting out a straight forward, exploration, sometimes word by word, of what the Apostles‚Äô Creed means. It is not super long. The chapters are short. It would make a very good small group study or personal devotional reading. Just in the past couple years I have read books on the creed by Hans von Balthasar, Derek Vreeland and JI Packer and attempted a video series on the Apostles‚Äô Creed with a small group.Of the books I have read on the Creed, none have been horrible, but Myers‚Äô book on the Apostles‚Äô Creed is the one I would recommend first. There are a couple of reasons,1) it is ecumenical. The biggest problem with von Bathasar and Packer‚Äôs books on the creed where they were assuming either Catholic or Reformed understandings of Christianity. Meyers is a Protestant and probably has a few statements that are too Protestant for Catholic or Orthodox readers, but he does not, as Packer does, complain about other streams of Christian faith‚Äôs understanding of Christianity while explicating one of the most important ecumenical statements of faith.2) Myers is intentionally being introductory. This is a book of discipleship, not scholarship. That does not mean it is simplistic or anti-academic, but that it is not primarily concerned with academic theology or small nuances of Christian faith, but about the broad stream of Christianity that can be shared among all.3) It is short. The creed is short. A book about the creed, especially one that it oriented toward teaching large swaths of Christians, should also be short. You could, although I would not recommend it, read this in a single sitting. The orientation of the book is to read it slowly, pondering it and even better discussing it. Christian faith is not primarily an individualistic faith, but a communal one. The creed is not a statement of personal individual faith, but an affirmation of a universal, communal statement of belief.

Title: TheApostlesCreedMinusGoodTheology
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2019
Review: The author has put together a very nice devotional and some good thoughts on many parts of the creed. Several times i have a note or star in the margin for an excellent point he has made. The book is worth reading to get another viewpoint on the Apostles Creed and it has many good notes.However, in the creedal lines of Jesus "descending into hell" and "the judgment" the author takes a separate path from orthodox Christianity and then in lies the faults of this book. It is obvious that the author does not picture of gracious and merciful God who is also holy and just. Thus, when Christ descended into hell, he preached the gospel again nd all the souls in help follow Christ into Paradise. Some call it Universalism or second-chance theology, but his opinion has no support from Scripture.Secondly, on the issue of judgment the author has taken the pathway that everyone gets to go into heaven. Judgment is only a matter of how much we enjoy heaven and God. For the saints, they will rejoice in God's presence (like a very wonderful teacher that you love in a classroom). For the sinner, they do inherit heaven, but that same teacher is disliked and so there is nothing enjoyable about being intuit "classroom." Again, the author has strayed from Orthodox teachings very widely.While the book does give several good insights, I recommend you read it with plenty of good theology ungirding yourself and your own reading.

Review: This is not an in-depth analysis of the Creed but a good overview. I was surprised how small it was (the dimensions are in the detail section, though) as it really is only 1/2 thick!Ben does a good job pushing one back into the Creed and the formulation of it. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to lead a Sunday School/Bible Study class in the Creed.

Title: AgoodintroductiontotheApostlesCreed
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2019
Review: This is a good introduction to the Apostles Creed. There are places where I felt uneasy, specifically the author's description of Christ descending into hell and a statement he makes about "the church is salvation". That seemed very medieval to me. Taking two stars may seem harsh but I feel the author was stretching things when taking about Christ descending. It almost made me not want to finish the book. Overall I say you can read this book, but as with all books, check against the scriptures it seeks to summarize. I will update this review after I compare with Albert Mohler's book on the Creed. I know from looking at a print copy that he is much more cautious one Christ descending which I think is better.

Review: Ben Myers has written a wonderful book that illuminates and edifies, inviting deep reflection on the Apostle's Creed. This book explains basic Christian convictions, tells the story of Jesus (while pointing toward the wider redemptive arc of the Bible), and creates space for the mystery of faith, incorporating insights from scholars and theologians old and new. I strongly recommend this book as a discipleship resource for those interested in Christianity, beginners in the faith, and for experienced saints.

Title: AHelpfulIntroduction
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2019
Review: Ben Myers provides a good summary of the theology, history, and culture behind the Apostles' Creed. He devotes a chapter to each portion of the creed. And he gives helpful references to early church fathers, which help to place the creed in its historical context.The Apostles' Creed was an important part of Christian identity in the early church. New Christians confessed it at baptism. This public profession identified a person with the Christian community.The creed continues to be confessed today around the world in Christian communities. Myers notes that it references Pontius Pilate to "remind us that God has acted at a particular moment in human history. The salvation of the world can be dated. Certain people were there when it happened."Overall, this is a valuable overview. It is recommended for individual or group study, especially to those who are new to or curious about Christianity.
